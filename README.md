Hello!!!!
This was my a-level project! It was my first ever project so it contains many mistakes and bad habits (I cannot believe I wrote all that in one single file:/). My skills improved so much since then...
Even if the project may have turned out messy, It was a huge learning experience and I would not be the same programmer without this.
Thank you!!!
P.S. I cannot run this project as I deleted the database. Hopefully one day I will be able to show off the result in my digital portfolio!!!
P.S.2. This project is meant to be an agenda. Users could add events or tasks. For each task or event completed, users would get coffee beans that could be used to
interact with the virtual pet or play sudoku. Many resources were used to make this app. In particular, I want to give my credit to the creator of the sudoku algorithms that can be found on Computing101 (https://www.101computing.net/sudoku-generator-algorithm/)
