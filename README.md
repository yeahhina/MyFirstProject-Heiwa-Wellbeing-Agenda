Hello!!!!
This was my a-level project! It was my first ever project so it contains many mistakes and nad habits (I cannot believe I wrote all that in one single file:/). My skills improved so much since then...
Even if the project may have turned out messy, It was a huge learning experience and I would not be the same programmer without this.
Thank you!!!
P.S. I cannot run this project as I deleted the database. Hopefull one day I will be able to show off the result in my digital portfolio!!!
